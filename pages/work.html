            An application I built to allow users to search for TV shows and Movies. It pulls in the description and
            release dates as well as the poster from The Movie DB API. You can use the search function at the top of the
            page or simply look on the first page for the most recent releases (please note that this will pull in shows
            and movies from all over the world).

            This is a weight loss tracking app. The user can input a date they wish to add a weight change and it will
            do the calculation for them, showing their current weight as well as all gains and losses of their weight
            over time.

            accessible site for people who wanted to get a quick glance at my work and who I am. In fact, you probably
            went to that site to get to this one (or maybe you went to my github).</p>
