                        I'm a father, a gamer, a web developer and guitarist.
                        I have been working as a Freelancer and learning more about web developement since my college
                        days.
                        My current desire is to find a job working for either a startup with a solid concept or a well
                        established
                        company that is willing to bring me in and give me professional level training to progress my
                        career.

                        I also love playing games with my kids, rocking out on my awesome Epiphone Les Paul every night
                        and
                        constantly learning new things.
