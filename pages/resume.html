                    <h3>Freelance web developer</h3>
                    <p>My friend and I started our own small business in 2018 to make websites, custom logos/designs,
                        and create and edit videos for companies. This was mainly a side project as we both have full
                        time jobs. I also used this to gain experience creating both professional and personal websites
                        for clients.</p>
